Project Description: The completed version of our project will be a 2-dimensional vertical shooting game where after choosing a stage from the stage menu, enemies come out from the top and sides and shoot projectiles downward at the spaceship that the user will be controlling. The user will be facing upward from the bottom toward the enemies, which they will have to shoot down from their spaceship they’re controlling. The game will have levels where it will get more difficult as the game progresses and there will be challenging boss battles where the user will have to take down larger and tougher enemies. There is also a shop menu to unlock upgrades for the user’s spaceship to make it stronger.

MVP: The most minimal feature our project should have is the main menu with the option to play the game. The game should include at least one stage with the player’s ship able to move around the screen. The game should be able to send obstacles for the player to avoid and shoot at. The player should also have the ability to shoot. If the player’s ship is destroyed or the level is beaten, it should bring the player back to the main menu. Additionally, the player should be able to pause and quit the game.

Project Platform: Windows Application
